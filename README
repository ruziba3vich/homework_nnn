This project is for employees to apply for new jobs, the application uses GoRoutines in some services, I used a database to store all data. However everytime in every request referring to the database makes the API work quite slowly, hence I used a manual database, too. I stored all the data in Go's built-in slices, the goroutines work in those parts, which going to the real database and manual ones. They both work at the same time.
